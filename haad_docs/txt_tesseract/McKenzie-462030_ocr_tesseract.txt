CORREQTIVE MINERAL DEED

THIS INDENTURE is made by and between Herman C. and Anna M. Thompson,
husband and-wife, whose post ofﬁce address is PO. Box 671, Watford City, North
Dakota 58854, hereinafter “Grantors”, and Peggy Wold and Jimmy Thompson, as
trustees of the Herman and Anna Thompson Irrevocable Mineral Trust dated August 16,
2013, whose post ofﬁce address is PO. Box 611, Watford City, North Dakota 58854,
hereinafter “Grantees”.

WITNESSET H:

That the Grantors, for and in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars ($10.00)
and other good and valuable consideration to them paid by Grantees, the receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, do by these presents, GRANT, BARGAIN, SELL,
CONVEY, TRANSFER, ASSlGN AND DELIVER unto the Grantees:

1. A one tenth (1/10) interest of the Grantors in and to all of the oil, gas, and ali
other minerals in and under and that may be produced from the following
described lands situated in McKenzie County, State of North Dakota:

Township 152 North, Range 29
Section 26: 81/2

Section 35: E1/2W1/2

2. A one eighth (1/8) interest of the Grantors in and to all of the oil, gas, and all
other minerals in and under and that may be produced from the following
described lands situated in McKenzie County, State of North Dakota:

Townshi 1 1 orth Ran
Section 1: Lot 3, SE1/4NW1/4; E1/28W1/4; N1/28E1/4

Township 151 North. Rangigﬁ
Section 6: Lot 6; NE1/4SW1/4

together with the right of ingress and egress at all times for the purpose of mining,
drilling, exploring, operating and developing said lands for oil, gas, and all other
minerals, and incident to the ownership thereof which grantors have the right and title to
grant.

This deed corrects the Mineral Deed dated August 16, 2013, recorded with the
County Recorder for McKenzie County as Document No. 455780 which incorrectly
named Herman C. Thompson and Anna M. Thompson as Trustees of the Thompson
lrrevowble Trust. The Trustees of the Trust on the date of the deed were Peggy Wold
and Jimmy Thompson and that deed is amended by this Corrective Mineral Deed to

name the appropriate Trustees. This deed further corrects the legal descriptions of the
property in Township 151 North, Range 99 West, Section 1, which through scrivener’s
error ambiguously described the property in that Section and which is now described in
this Corrective Deed as Section 1, Lot 3, SE1/4NW1/4, E1/28W1/4 and N1/ZSE1/4 and
the legal description of the property in Township 151 North, Range 98 West, which is
now described in this Corrective Mineral Deed as Section 6, Lot 6 and the NE1/4SW1I4.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Grantors have caused this Deed to be executed as
of this date.
