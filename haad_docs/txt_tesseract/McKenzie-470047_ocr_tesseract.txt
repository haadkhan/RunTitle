Future Advances are secured by this Mortgage whether or not Mortgagee is obligated to make
the Future Advances. The Future Advances are secured as if made on the date of this Mortgage.

paid, and despite that the aggregate amount of the advances evidenced by the Loan Documents
may exceed the initial aggregate principal balance secured by this Mortgage and despite that
certain advances may be non-obligatory, until the obligations of Mortgagee to make further
advances under the Loan Documents is terminated and all of the secured indebtedness is fully
and finally paid or performed and no further secured indebtedness may thereaﬁer arise. The
