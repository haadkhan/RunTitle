plan or agreement. In the event that said above described lands or any part thereof, shall hereafter be
operated under any such cooperative or unit plan of development or operation whereby the production .
therefrom is allocated to different portions of the land covered by said plan, then the production
allocated to any particular tract of land shall, for the purpose of computing the royalties to be paid
hereunder to Lessor, be regarded as having been produced from the particular tract of land to which it
is allocated and not to any other tract of land; and the royalty payments to be made hereunder to
Lessor shall be based upon production only as so allocated.
