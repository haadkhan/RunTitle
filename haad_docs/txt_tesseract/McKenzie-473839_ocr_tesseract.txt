purpose of computing the royalties to be paid hereunder to Lessor, be regarded as having been produced from the
particular tract of land to which it is allocated and not to any other tract of land; and the royalty payments to be made
hereunder to Lessor shall be based upon production only as so allocated. Lessor shall formally express Lessor's
consent to any cooperative or unit plan of development or operation adopted by Lessee and approved by any
governmental agency by executing the same upon request of Lessee.
