provisions of any agreement pertaining to the foregoing to anyone without the express written

GRANTEE’s installation of the Facilities, such restoration to include the repair of any cut fences,
leveling of the ground, and cleaning up all debris, and removing all rocks 4 inches in diameter or
larger unearthed, in each case, as a result of its Facilities installation. GRANTEE further agrees to
reseed, at GRANTEE’ S expense, the area in which the grass and foliage were destroyed as a result of

completion of each pipeline to make a reasonable determination that the surface of the land and the

buildings, barns, workshops, improvements, engineering works, or other structures within the
Easement Area nor shall GRANTOR change, or permit the change of, the grade of the surface of the
ground within the Easement Area. If aﬁer the initial laying, construction, installation and operation

a result of construction of the initial pipeline within the Easement Area.

adding to or changing the terms of the same. Except as provided in the immediately preceding
paragraph, this Agreement shall not be abrogated, modified, rescinded or amended in whole or in
part without the consent of GRANTEE and GRANTOR, in writing and executed by each of them,
and duly recorded in the appropriate real property records.

and easement shall create a covenant and burden on the Property and running therewith.

for any use, which hinders, conﬂicts or interferes with the purposes for which this right of way and
easement is granted.

successors and assigns, until such Facilities are constructed and so long thereafter as any of the
Facilities are maintained thereon, and the undersigned hereby bind themselves, their heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns, against every person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to

other persons legally due any portion of the monies hereto paid for damages. '
