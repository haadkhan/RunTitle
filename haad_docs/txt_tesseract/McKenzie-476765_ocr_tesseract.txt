2.1 Mortgagor represents and warrants to, and covenants and agrees with, Mortgagee and
any other holder or holders from time to time of the Obligations or any part thereof or any interest
therein (herein collectively called “Holder”) and with each of them, so long as the Obligations or any
part thereof remains unpaid, as follows.

(a) Mortgagor, or Mortgagor’s predecessor or predecessors in title to each of the
Mortgaged Properties, have properly and timely performed whatever may be required by the
provisions of each of the Leases (or by any contract, assignment or conveyance under which
Mortgagor holds title to any of the Mortgaged Properties) to perpetuate the Leases and to perfect or
maintain Mortgagor’s title. Mortgagor shall pay and discharge or cause to be paid or discharged all
rentals, delay rentals, royalties, production payments, and Obligations required to be paid by
Mortgagor, and perform or cause to be performed, each and every act, matter, or thing required of
Mortgagor by each and all of the Leases, assignments, deeds, subleases, contracts and agreements in
any way relating to the Mortgaged Properties and do all other things necessary of Mortgagor to keep
unimpaired the rights of Mortgagor thereunder and to prevent the forfeiture thereof or default
thereunder.

(b) Mortgagor has good and defensible title to and is possessed of the Mortgaged
Properties, free of any and all adverse claims, rights of others, liens, encumbrances, security interest,
contracts, agreements, preferential purchase rights or other restrictions or limitations of any nature or
kind except those which may be speciﬁed in Exhibit “A” or in the Loan Agreement (herein
collectively called the “Permitted Encumbrances”). Mortgagor will at all times protect and defend
the title to all of the Mortgaged Properties, paying all expenses incurred or to be incurred in
defending the title to the same against all claims or charges other than the Permitted Encumbrances,
and will indemnify and hold Holder harmless against any such claims or charges other than the
Permitted Encumbrances.

(c) Mortgagor owns an undivided interest in the Leases. No operating agreement,
contract or other agreement affecting any part of the Mortgaged Properties to which Mortgagor is a
party or to which Mortgagor is bound requires Mortgagor to bear any of the costs relating to the
Mortgaged Properties greater than the working interest of Mortgagor in any such portion of the
Mortgaged Properties, except in the event that Mortgagor is obligated under an Operating Agreement
to assume a portion of a non—consenting party’s share of costs and expenses and, as a result thereof
shall own and be entitled to receive an equivalent portion of such non-consenting party’s interest in
the well and share of Hydrocarbons produced therefrom. All proceeds from the sale of Mortgagor’s
share of the Hydrocarbons being produced from the Mortgaged Properties are currently being paid in
full to Mortgagor by the purchasers thereof on a timely basis and none of such proceeds are currently
being held in suspense by such purchasers or any other party.

(d) Mortgagor has full power and lawful authority to bargain, grant, sell, mortgage,
assign, transfer, convey and grant a security interest in all of the Mortgaged Properties all in the
manner and form herein provided and without obtaining the waiver, consent or approval of any
lessor, sublessor, governmental agency or entity or party whomsoever or whatsoever. ‘

the cancellation of or in any manner affecting any of the Leases or any land covered or purported to
be covered thereby or the land or the title of Mortgagor thereto.

interest in, any of the Mortgaged Properties or encumber or allow to be encumbered any of the

other party, other than the Permitted Encumbrances.

(g) ~ Mortgagor ’shall pay and discharge promptly all taxes, assessments, and governmental
charges or levies imposed upon Mortgagor or upon the income of Mortgagor or of any of the
Mortgaged Properties or Hydrocarbons as well as all claims of any kind (including claims for labor,
materials, supplies and rent) which, if unpaid, might become a lien upon any or all of the Mortgaged
Properties or Hydrocarbons; provided, however, that Mortgagor shall not be required to pay any such
tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim if the amount, applicability or validity thereof shall currently
be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and if Mortgagor shall
have set up cash reserves therefor adequate under generally accepted accounting principles.

(h) Mortgagor shall operate or cause to be operated all Mortgaged Properties in a careful
and efﬁcient manner in accordance with the practice of the industry and in compliance with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, and, in the case of Leases, in compliance with all applicable
proration and conservation laws of the State in which the Leases are situated, and all applicable laws,
rules and regulations of every other agency and authority from time to time constituted to regulate
the development and operation of the Leases and the production and sale of Hydrocarbons therefrom;
provided, however, Mortgagor shall have the right to contest in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, the applicability or lawfulness of any such law, rule or regulation and, pending such
contest, may defer compliance therewith, so long as such deferment shall not subject the Mortgaged
Properties or any part thereof to foreclosure or loss.

(i) Mortgagor shall ensure that all contracts for services, labor or materials necessary for
any operation conducted or performed on any portion of the Mortgaged Properties are awarded on
the basis of competitive arms-length negotiations with qualiﬁed contractors or subcontractors at rates
which do not exceed those prevailing for equivalent services, labor or materials in the area where the
portion of Mortgaged Properties affected by a particular operation is situated. To the extent that any
Affiliate of Mortgagor is employed to provide any such services, labor or materials, Mortgagor shall
ensure that the Afﬁliate is employed pursuant to a written agreement providing for payment for such
services, labor or materials (a) at a rate which is comparable to and competitive with that of unrelated
third parties rendering comparable services or supplying comparable labor and materials and
(b) which are reasonably necessary for, and actually furnished to, the operations conducted on the
Mortgaged Properties.

(k) Mortgagor shall maintain with ﬁnancially sound and reputable insurers, insurance
with respect to the Mortgaged Properties and the operations thereof against such liabilities,
casualties, risks and contingencies, and in such types and amounts, as are customary in the case of
companies engaged in the same or similar businesses and similarly situated; upon request of Holder,
Mortgagor will furnish or cause to be furnished to Holder a summary of the insurance coverage of
Mortgagor in form and substance satisfactory to Holder together with copies of the applicable
policies and proof of payment of the premiums therefor. In the case of any ﬁre, accident or other
casualty causing loss or damage to any of the Mortgaged Properties, the procwds of such policy shall
be used (i) to repair or replace the damaged Mortgaged Properties or (ii) to prepay the Obligations in
any manner or order as elected by Holder at the time of such prepayment. If requested by Holder, the
loss payable clauses or provisions in said policy or policies shall be endorsed in favor of and made
payable to Holder in accordance with the preceding sentence.

(1) Mortgagor shall permit any ofﬁcer, employee or agent of Holder to visit and inspect
any of the Mortgaged Properties, examine Mortgagor’s books of record and accounts, take copies
and extracts therefrom, and discuss the affairs, ﬁnances and accounts of Mortgagor with Mortgagor’s
accountants and auditors, all at such reasonable times and as often as Holder may desire.

(m) Mortgagor shall do and perform every act and discharge all of the Obligations
provided to be performed and discharged by Mortgagor under the Loan Agreement, the Note and
under this Mortgage at the time or times and in the manner speciﬁed.

(11) Mortgagor shall cure promptly any defects in the creation and issuance of the Note
and the execution and delivery of this Mortgage. Mortgagor at its own expense will promptly
execute and deliver to Holder upon request all such other and further documents, agreements and
instruments in compliance with or accomplishment of the covenants and agreements of Mortgagor
herein or to further evidence and more fully describe the Mortgaged Properties, or to correct any
