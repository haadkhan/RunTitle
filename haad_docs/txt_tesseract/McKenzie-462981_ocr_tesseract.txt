at law for the seizure and sale of the mortgaged property included in the Collateral or any part thereof, for the
speciﬁc performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or in aid of the execution of any power herein
granted, for the foreclosure or sale of such mortgaged property or any part thereof under the judgment or decree of

of such mortgaged property or any part thereof or for the enforcement of any other appropriate equitable or legal
remedy.

other rights and remedies herein conferred, Secured Party shall have all of the rights and remedies of an assignee

restricts the customary manner of sale or distribution of any such property, Secured Party may sell such property
privately or in any other manner deemed advisable by Secured Party at such price or prices as Secured Party
determines in the sole diScretion of Secured Party. Debtor recognizes that such prohibition or restriction may cause
such property to have less value than it otherwise would have and that, consequently, such sale or disposition by
Secured Party may result in a lower sales price than if the sale were otherwise held.

manner provided herein. Debtor does hereby ratify and conﬁrm all legal acts that Secured Party may do in carrying
out the provisions of this instrument.

operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim and demand of the Debtor in and to the property sold and will be a
perpetual bar against Debtor.

any time have or assert any right pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the exemption of homesteads, the sale of
property in the inverse order of alienation, the administration of estates of decedents, appraisement, valuation, stay,
execution or redemption now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the rights of Secured Party or any
purchaser of the Collateral or any part thereof under this instrument. Debtor, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, hereby waives the beneﬁt of all such laws.

Section 5.9 All costs and expenses, including reasonable attomeys' fees and legal expenses, incurred by

and not exclusive, and each and every right, power and remedy whether speciﬁcally hereby granted or otherwise
existing may be exercised from time to time and as often and in such order as may be deemed expedient by Secured
Party and the exercise of any such right, power or remedy will not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise, at the
same time or thereafter, any other right, power or remedy. N0 delay or omission by Secured Party in the exercise of
any right, power or remedy will impair any such right, power or remedy or operate as a waiver thereof or of any
other right, power or remedy then or thereaﬁer existing. Any and all covenants in this instrument may from time to
time by instrument in writing signed by Secured Party be waived to such extent and in such manner as Secured Party
may desire, but no such waiver will ever affect or impair Secured Party’s rights hereunder, except to the extent

signed by Secured Party.

Obligations is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction all other provisions hereof or of said written instruments
shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and the remaining provisions hereof will be liberally
construed in favor of Secured Party in order to carry out the provisions hereof. The invalidity of any provisions of
this instrument in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of any such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Any reference herein contained to a statute of law of a State in which no part of the Collateral is
situated will be deemed inapplicable to, and not used in, the interpretation hereof.

Section 6.4 This instrument is made with full substitution and subrogation of Secured Party in and to all
covenants and warranties by others heretofore given or made in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof.

mortgage, contract, financing statement, or security agreement, and from time to time as any one or more thereof is
appropriate under applicable State law.

year of 360 days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no rate of interest required
hereunder or under the Obligations shall exceed the maximum legal rate under the applicable law, and, in the event
any such rate is found to exceed such maximum legal rate, Debtor shall be required to pay only such maximum legal
rate.

Section 6.7 Insofar as permitted by otherwise applicable law, this instrument and the Obligations shall be
